## Bellosi Jacopo - Thesis Bachelor Degree
# Abstract
This thesis proposes the development of an AI chat system designed for career enhancement, focusing initially on analyzing users' resumes to provide tailored feedback on elements such as job titles, design, and summary sections. Subsequently, users can engage in interactive dialogue, seeking advice on career paths, requesting revisions to their resume summaries, and obtaining salary expectations. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system aims to streamline the career development process, offering personalized guidance and insights to empower users in their professional endeavors. 
The project will involve UX design, user research, and testing to ensure the effectiveness and usability of the chat application. Through this research, I aim to create a comprehensive tool that facilitates informed decision-making and fosters career growth for individuals.
